#TODO: Make sure latest bets are in system



#I am a user logged in- on my detail page I can see the current system performance for all systems


#For all systems to which I am subscribed I can see today's candidates (bets), sorted by time by default


#to see the current price I need to be able to get the latest data from oddschecker.

#I can sort this table by bet odds
