#mi

A Django app which displays historical and live performance data for GBR racing systems and combinations of systems (=funds).
All tracked and non-tracked systems are based on real-life tipping scenarios backed up by data from the past 3 seasons (and not the other way round)

This repo contains the main Django app code, importers
Data collection code is elsewhere on this repo (rppost)


Developers:
FONAR is the primary branch for the time being
